# segment-analytics

This is a hard fork of the original library [`segmentio/analytics.js-core`](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics.js-core) with a focus on the following items:

- Modernizing the codebase and tooling
- Better support with [`segmentio/typewriter`](https://github.com/segmentio/typewriter) 
- Support for modern browsers
- Easy integration with Single Page Application and existing Node build systems.

This codebase is not designed to be a drop-in replacement for the  [Analytics.js](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics.js) snippet and we will not support Analytics.JS in this fashion.

## Installing
