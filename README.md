This is a hard fork of the original library [`segmentio/analytics.js-core`](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics.js-core) which is the main driver behind [`segmentio/analytics.js`](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics.js).

We are primarly focusing on the following items with this hard fork:

- Modernizing the codebase and tooling
- Better support with [`segmentio/typewriter`](https://github.com/segmentio/typewriter)
- Support for modern browsers
- Easy integration with Single Page Application and existing Node build systems.

## Project Status

This code is to be considered in an alpha state, so use at your own risk till things are more stable. This codebase is also not designed to be a drop-in replacement for the [Analytics.js](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics.js) snippet. There are no plans to support

Check out the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/bryanmikaelian/segment-analytics/projects/1) for the roadmap and the latest state of the project.
